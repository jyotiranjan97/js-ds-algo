### Linear Search

> - To search a given value from an array, is to check one by one each element.
> - Time Complexity - O(n)
>
> See [LinearSearch.js](LinearSearch.js) for understanding.

### Binary Search

> - Binary search is a much faster form of search.
> - Rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time
> - Binary search only works on sorted arrays!
> - Time complexity - O(log(n))
>
> See [BinarySearch.js](BinarySearch.js) for understanding.

### Naive String Search

> - Suppose you want to count the number of times a smaller string appears in a longer string.
> - A straightforward approach involves checking pairs of characters individually.
