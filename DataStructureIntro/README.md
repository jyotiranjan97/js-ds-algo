## Data Structure

- **Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.**
- **Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.**

> ### Class
>
> A blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods.

> See [Class.js](Class.js) for reference

> #### Static
>
> The static keyword defines a static method or property for a class. Neither static methods nor static properties can be called on instances of the class. Instead, they're called on the class itself.
