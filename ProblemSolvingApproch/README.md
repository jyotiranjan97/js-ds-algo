# Problem Solving Approach

> - **Understand the Problem**
> - **Explore Concrete Examples**
> - **Break it Down**
> - **Solve/Simplify**
> - **Look back and Refactor**

### Understand the Problem

1. Restate the Problem in **own words**.
2. **Inputs** that go into the problem
3. **Outputs** that should come from solution of the problem
4. Can the Outputs be **Determined** by from Provided Inputs?
5. Label **Important Pieces of Data** that are part of the Problem

> See [SumOfNum.js](SumOfNum.js) for details

### Concrete Examples

1. Start with Simple Examples
2. Progress with more Complex Examples
3. Explore Example with Empty Input
4. Explore with Invalid Example

> See [CharCount.js](CharCount.js) for details

### Break it Down

Divide the Problem into **Different Steps**

> See [CharCount.js](CharCount.js) for details

### Solve/Simplify

According to previous **Step** write code to solve the Problem

> See [CharCount.js](CharCount.js) for details

### Look back and Refactor

1. Are all **Corner Cases** are considered?
2. Is it the most **Efficient** solution?
3. What is **Big O** of this solution?
4. Can it be solved in **Different** way?
