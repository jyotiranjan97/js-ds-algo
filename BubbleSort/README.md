## Sorting

> Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order.
>
> There are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have their own **advantages** and **disadvantages**.
>
> Examples:
>
> - Sorting numbers from smallest to largest.
> - Sorting names alphabetically.
> - Sorting movies based on release year.
> - Sorting movies based on revenue.

### Default sort() method

> The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into **strings**, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values.
>
> The array elements are converted to strings, then sorted according to each character's **Unicode** code point value.
>
> See [DefaultSort.js](DefaultSort.js) for reference.

### Bubble Sort

> A sorting algorithm where the largest values **bubble up** to the top!
>
> See [BubbleSort.js](BubbleSort.js) and [OptimizedBubbleSort.js](OptimizedBubbleSort.js) for reference.
