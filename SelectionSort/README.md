### Selection Sort

- Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position.
- Here number of swaps are lower in comparison to bubble sort.
- So if we have contraint on multiple writes on memory then we should consider this.
- Time Complexity - O(n^2)
