### Insertion Sort

> - Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted
> - It works well when data is coming online and we want to sort them as soon it arrives.
> - Time Complexity - O(n^2)
>
> See [InsertionSort.js](InsertionSort.js) for reference.

## Difference between Bubble, Selection & Insertion Sort

| Algorithm      | Time Complexity (Best) | Time Complexity (Average) | Time Complexity (Worst) | Space Complexity |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Bubble Sort    | O(n)                   | O(n^2)                    | O(n^2)                  | O(1)             |
| Insertion Sort | O(n)                   | O(n^2)                    | O(n^2)                  | O(1)             |
| Selection Sort | O(n^2)                 | O(n^2)                    | O(n^2)                  | O(1)             |

> Bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort are all roughly equivalent
> All have average time complexities that are quadratic
