## Doubly Linked List

Almost identical to Singly Linked Lists, except every node has another pointer, to the previous node!

---

### Push

**Adding a node to the end of the Doubly Linked List**

- Create a new node with the value passed to the function
- If the head property is null set the head and tail to be the newly created node
- If not, set the next property on the tail to be that node
- Set the previous property on the newly created node to be the tail
- Set the tail to be the newly created node
- Increment the length
- Return the Doubly Linked List

> See [DoublyLinkedList.js](DoublyLinkedList.js) for implementation

---

### Pop

**Removing a node from the end of the Doubly Linked List**

- If there is no head, return undefined
- Store the current tail in a variable to return later
- If the length is 1, set the head and tail to be null
- Update the tail to be the previous Node.
- Set the newTail's next to null
- Decrement the length
- Return the value removed

> See [DoublyLinkedList.js](DoublyLinkedList.js) for implementation

---

### Shift

**Removing a node from the beginning of the Doubly Linked List**

- If length is 0, return undefined
- Store the current head property in a variable (we'll call it old head)
- If the length is one
- set the head to be null
- set the tail to be null
- Update the head to be the next of the old head
- Set the head's prev property to null
- Set the old head's next to null
- Decrement the length
- Return old head

> See [DoublyLinkedList.js](DoublyLinkedList.js) for implementation

### Unshift

**Adding a node to the beginning of the Doubly Linked List**

- Create a new node with the value passed to the function
- If the length is 0
- Set the head to be the new node
- Set the tail to be the new node
- Otherwise
- Set the prev property on the head of the list to be the new node
- Set the next property on the new node to be the head property
- Update the head to be the new node
- Increment the length
- Return the list

> See [DoublyLinkedList.js](DoublyLinkedList.js) for implementation

### Get

**Accessing a node in a Doubly Linked List by its position**

- If the index is less than 0 or greater or equal to the length, return null
- If the index is less than or equal to half the length of the list
  - Loop through the list starting from the head and loop towards the middle
  - Return the node once it is found
- If the index is greater than half the length of the list
  - â€‹Loop through the list starting from the tail and loop towards the middle
  - Return the node once it is found

> See [DoublyLinkedList.js](DoublyLinkedList.js) for implementation

### Set

**Replacing the value of a node to the in a Doubly Linked List**

- Create a variable which is the result of the get method at the index passed to the function
- If the get method returns a valid node, set the value of that node to be the value passed to the function, Return true
- Otherwise, return false

> See [DoublyLinkedList.js](DoublyLinkedList.js) for implementation

---

### Insert

**Adding a node in a Doubly Linked List by a certain position**

- If the index is less than zero or greater than or equal to the length return false
- If the index is 0, unshift
- If the index is the same as the length, push
- Use the get method to access the index -1
- Set the next and prev properties on the correct nodes to link everything together
- Increment the length
- Return true

> See [DoublyLinkedList.js](DoublyLinkedList.js) for implementation

---

### Remove

**Removing a node in a Doubly Linked List by a certain position**

- If the index is less than zero or greater than or equal to the length return undefined
- If the index is 0, shift
- If the index is the same as the length-1, pop
- Use the get method to retrieve the item to be removed
- Update the next and prev properties to remove the found node from the list
- Set next and prev to null on the found node
- Decrement the length
- Return the removed node.

> See [DoublyLinkedList.js](DoublyLinkedList.js) for implementation

### Reverse Link List

**Reversing a Doubly Linked List in place!**

- Create a variable called current and set it to be the head of the list
- Create a variable called tail and set it to be the head of the list
- Loop through the list and set the next property of the current node to be the prev property of the current node
- If there is no next property, set the tail to be the head and the head to be the current variable
- Return the list

> See [ReverseLinkedList.js](ReverseLinkedList.js) for implementation

### Big O

- **Insertion** - O(n)
- **Removal** - O(1)
- **Search** - O(n)
- **Access** - O(n)
- **Reverse** - O(n)

### Summary

- Doubly Linked Lists are almost identical to Singly Linked Lists except there is an additional pointer to previous nodes
- Better than Singly Linked Lists for finding nodes and can be done in half the time!
- However, they do take up more memory considering the extra pointer
- Doubly linked lists are used to implement other data structures and certain types of caches
